This program generates a random maze Using a deep first search algorithm
where the shortest way/solution to the maze is found with the A* algorithm.
The A* algorithm is vizulised with pygame.

CELL COLOR CODING:
GREEN : Start and end points
BLUE : Shortest way
RED : Closed cell (checked)
YELLOW : Open cell (unchecked)
